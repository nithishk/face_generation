# Face_generation Project Overview

Goal of this project is to train a DCGAN on a dataset of faces

The aim is to use generative adversarial networks and generate new images of faces that look as reaslitic as possible. 

# Getting started



# Get the Data

You'll be using the [CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA)](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) to train your adversarial networks.

Open the face_generation.ipynb on a GPU enabled Python notebook evironment. The notebook consists of further technical details. Run the notebook to generate your own unique and random face images 

### Further improvements
* Create a deeper model and use it to generate larger (say 128 x 128) images of faces. 
* Read existing literature to see if using padding and normalization techniques generates higher - resoultion images.
